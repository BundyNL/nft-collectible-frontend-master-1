# NFT Collectible Assessment

This is how far I got, which isn't far. The ABI code both initial and deployed are included in the JSON file. The smart contract with the requested parameters is deployed to the Ropsten ETH testnetwork under the name BundyAssessment. The connect wallet button is replaced with the mint button upon succesful linkage, after reloading the site it's automatically detected that a valid previously connected wallet and it will show the mint button instead. 

App.js includes only a fraction of the functions from my smart contract and I'm not skilled enough yet to display them in the front-end, but am able to use them from the back-end.
